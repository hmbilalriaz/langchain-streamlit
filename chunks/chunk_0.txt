DSPy - Programming—not prompting—LMs 
DSPy is the framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows 
you to iterate fast on building modular AI systems and offers algorithms for optimizing their 
prompts and weights, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or 
Agent loops. 
DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write
